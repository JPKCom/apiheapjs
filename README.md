# apiheapjs
apiheap.js is a small library that lets you make, and parse REST requests in under 5 lines of code. 
To learn more, and for usage, [visit the project page.](http://tash-had.github.io/apiheapjs/). 

# Notice
The code isn't properly documented. Terrible, I know. I wrote this in high-school, when I neglected to care about good programming etiquette. Though the liibrary is <b>heavily</b> documented. [Check it out here!](http://tash-had.github.io/apiheapjs/)
